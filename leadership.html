      <p>Reverend Beverly S. Hudson accepted Jesus Christ and was baptized August 1975 at Mount Hermon Missionary
        Baptist Church in Bishopville, South Carolina under the leadership of the late Rev. Bert D. Lewis Sr. This is where she
        gained her biblical foundation and passion to serve the Lord.</p>
<p>
        Rev. Bev graduated in 1986 from Morris College in Sumter, South Carolina with a Bachelor of Science Degree in
        Mathematics. Rev. Bev is also a 2007 graduate of Jameson School of Ministry with a Certificate in Biblical
        Studies and she is currently matriculating in the Master of Divinity Program at Palmer Theological Seminary.
        Professionally, she is an employee with the Department of Treasury.</p>
        <p>Rev. Bev is a member of the historic First African Baptist Church in Darby Township, Pennsylvania where the
        Reverend Dr. Richard A. Dent is the Pastor. In addition to her Ministerial Duties, Rev. Bev also serves in the following
        ministries: New Members Discipleship Training – Adult and Youth Instructor, the Word of Life Bookstore, Women’s
        Ministry, Youth Ministry and the Women of Faith Support Ministry.</p>
<p>
        When she was lost, Rev. Bev sought the Lord, He heard her and delivered her from all of her fears; at this
        point, she rededicated her life back to Jesus Christ and has not looked back. As she began to study and meditate on the
        Word of God, she found herself experiencing the deeper things of God. After much prayer and fasting, she began
        to seek God for His will for her life and the result was her call to preach the Good News of Jesus Christ; she was
        licensed to preach on June 26, 2011 and ordained on November 4, 2012 by Rev. Dr. Richard A. Dent.</p>
<p>
        The Lord blessed Rev. Bev with one son, Chad Jonathan Hudson. For such a time as this, she stands on God’s
        promises and relies on, “Being confident of this, that He who began a good work in us will carry it on to completion
        until the day of Christ Jesus” – Philippians 1:6.</p>

      <p>Brother Kenneth J. D. Wilson was born a twin to the late Patricia Wilson and Kent Wilson in Nuremberg, Germany
        on
        November 8, 1980.
        Kenneth and his twin brother Kevin were raised by their grandparents, George (deceased) and Mary Atkings who
        took
        them to church and introduced them to the music ministry at an early age. Kenneth was baptized and spiritually
        cultivated at Second Pilgrim Baptist Church where he served on the youth choir and usher board. He later became
        a
        member of the New Way Missionary Baptist Church where he was an active youth leader, Junior Deacon, Usher and
        Choir
        Director.
        After graduating from Saint Joseph’s Preparatory School in 1999, Kenneth went on to earn his Bachelor of Arts
        degree
        in Sociology from the University of Connecticut and subsequently earned a Master’s in Criminal Justice with a
        concentration in Behavioral Analysis in 2006. Currently, he is matriculating in the Master of Divinity Program
        at
        Palmer Theological Seminary.
        Professionally, Kenneth is the Assistant Director of the Eva Donaldson School of Music. Driven by the need to
        mentor
        young men of all ages, Kenneth is the founder of “A Different Breed of Men”, a non-profit organization.
        After many years of wrestling with what he knew to be the voice of the Lord, Kenneth accepted the call of
        ministry
        on his life in March 2007.
        As a faithful member of First African Baptist Church, Kenneth continues to prune his gift for ministry as he
        actively serves in the following ministries: Discipleship training, Marriage Ministry, Men’s Ministry, Chosen
        300
        and Music Ministry.
        On May 12, 2012, Kenneth was united in marriage to his long time love Nicole G. Bynum; the Lord blessed them
        with
        three children: Tahjae, JaDen and Kai.
        In his servitude to the Lord, one of Kenneth’s favorite scripture is, “Moreover whom he did predestinate, them
        he
        also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: them he also glorified. What shall we then say to these
        things? If God be for us who can be against us?” - Romans 8:30-31
